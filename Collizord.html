    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Collizord is an AI-based accident detection and alert system designed to enhance road safety. It uses dashcam footage analyzed by a YOLO model, along with live location tracking and Twilio-powered emergency alerts. The system instantly notifies hospitals and contacts when a crash is detected. A force sensor module is planned as an add-on. Collizord targets car manufacturers, commercial fleets, and safety agencies with a subscription-based software model.</p>

  <section id="problem">
    <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <p><h4>Delayed Emergency Response:</h4> No witnesses report the crash in most accidents.
Victims remain unconscious for vital minutes or hours before
rescue.
Most hazardous when driving in rural roads or at night.</p>
    <p><h4>No Real-Time Location Sharing:</h4> Emergency responders do not know the precise location of the
crash.
Valuable time is lost trying to track down the accident</p>
    <p><h4>Existing Systems Are Incomplete:</h4> Dashcams can capture, but don't sense or alert.
Post-accident solutions (such as Tractable)
operate after the damage is already caused, not in
real time.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="solution">
    <h1>Our Solution</h1>
    <p><h4>Instant Accident Detection:</h4>  No witnesses account for the crash in the majority of accidents.
Victims are kept unconscious for critical minutes or hours until rescue.
Most dangerous when driving on rural roads or at night.</p>
    <p><h4>Live Location Tracking:</h4>  Emergency services have no idea where the crash took
place.Critical time is wasted searching for the accident</p>
    <p><h4>Multi-Sensor Fusion:</h4> Dashcams can record, but don't detect or warn.
Post-crash solutions (like Tractable) act after damage has already occurred, not in real-time.</p>
